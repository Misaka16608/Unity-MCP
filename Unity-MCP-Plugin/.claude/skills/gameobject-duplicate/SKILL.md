# GameObject / Duplicate

Duplicate GameObjects in opened Prefab or in a Scene. Use 'gameobject-find' tool to find the target GameObjects first.

## Behavior

Resolves every input ref on the main thread (throwing on any unresolved entry to keep the batch atomic). Sets `Selection.entityIds`/`instanceIDs` to the sources and invokes `Unsupported.DuplicateGameObjectsUsingPasteboard()` (Unity's canonical duplicate routine). Marks every distinct affected scene dirty so the duplicated objects are saved with the scene. Returns refs to the sources (the duplicates are reachable via the post-call `Selection`).

## How to Call

```bash
unity-mcp-cli run-tool gameobject-duplicate --input '{
  "gameObjectRefs": "string_value"
}'
```

> For complex input, save JSON to a file and use `unity-mcp-cli run-tool gameobject-duplicate --input-file args.json`.

### Troubleshooting

For CLI installation or connectivity issues, see the /unity-initial-setup skill.

## Input

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| `gameObjectRefs` | `any` | Yes | Array of GameObjects in opened Prefab or in the active Scene. |
